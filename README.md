# Delicious-Dine
It is a web-based website that is used to provide different food categories in a sorted manner. It manages the customer login ID details, like name, username, and password.

In this website, anyone can order the food that they are craving or pre-book it for dining.
We have made a navigation bar, home from where you’ll get an overview of our website, menu from which you can add food items to your cart, services for smooth delivery of your food, and our details from where you can contact us. We have an order button 
that jumps on the cart where you’ll get the items you have chosen and a login button from where you can become our permanent customer.
